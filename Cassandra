Cassandra database is distributed over several machines that operate together. The outermost container is known as the Cluster. 
For failure handling, every node contains a replica, and in case of a failure, the replica takes charge. 
Cassandra arranges the nodes in a cluster, in a ring format, and assigns data to them.

#Keyspace
Keyspace is the outermost container for data in Cassandra. The basic attributes of a Keyspace in Cassandra are
  Replication factor 
  Replica placement strategy
  Column families 


from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
cluster = Cluster(['127.0.0.1'])
session = cluster.connect() 
keyspace_query = """CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS sparkify 
                with REPLICATION = 
                { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1 }
            """
session.execute(keyspace_query)
session.set_keyspace('sparkify')
create_query1 = """CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS session_item (artist text, song text, length float, sessionId int, itemInSession int, PRIMARY KEY (sessionId, itemInSession))"""
session.execute(create_query1)
